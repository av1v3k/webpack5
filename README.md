# webpack5

Getting Started

- basic explanation.
- without parameter in cli, webpack runs in production mode.
- IIFE to unpolllute the code running in application.


3. Loaders

Syntax: 

```
module: {
    rules: [
        {test: , use: }
    ]
}
```

NOTE:

test - regular exp
use: loaders

- Order of the loader must be style-loader, css-loader, as webpack executes from right.
- Instead of using Array of String for use, we declare Array of Object to give options for each loader[The context here is author trying to explain css class names are unquiely generated by webpack & injected into the HTML]
